EC2 Instances Purchasing Options On-Demand Instances \u2013 short workload, predictable pricing, pay by second Reserved (1 & 3 years) Reserved Instances \u2013 long workloads Convertible Reserved Instances \u2013 long workloads with flexible instances Savings Plans (1 & 3 years) \u2013 commitment to an amount of usage, long workload Spot Instances \u2013 short workloads, cheap, can lose instances (less reliable) Dedicated Hosts \u2013 book an entire physical server, control instance placement Dedicated Instances \u2013 no other customers will share your hardware Capacity Reservations \u2013 reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration EC2 On Demand Pay for what you use: Linux or Windows - billing per second, after the first minute All other operating systems - billing per hour Has the highest cost but no upfront payment No long-term commitment Recommended for short-term and uninterrupted workloads, where you can't predict how the application will behave EC2 Reserved Instances Up to 72% discount compared to On-demand You reserve a specific instance attributes (Instance Type, Region, Tenancy, OS) Reservation Period \u2013 1 year (+discount) or 3 years (+++discount) Payment Options \u2013 No Upfront (+), Partial Upfront (++), All Upfront (+++) Reserved Instance\u2019s Scope \u2013 Regional or Zonal (reserve capacity in an AZ) Recommended for steady-state usage applications (think database) You can buy and sell in the Reserved Instance Marketplace Convertible Reserved Instance Can change the EC2 instance type, instance family, OS, scope, and tenancy Up to 66% discount Note: The % discounts are different over time \u2013 the exact numbers are not needed for the exam. This is just for illustrative purposes. EC2 Savings Plans Get a discount based on long-term usage (up to 72% - same as RIs) Commit to a certain type of usage ($10/hour for 1 or 3 years) Usage beyond EC2 Savings Plans is billed at the On-Demand price Locked to a specific instance family & AWS region (e.g., M5 in us-east-1) Flexible across: Instance Size (e.g., m5.xlarge, m5.2xlarge) OS (e.g., Linux, Windows) Tenancy (Host, Dedicated, Default) EC2 Spot Instances Can get a discount of up to 90% compared to On-demand Instances that you can \u201close\u201d at any point of time if your max price is less than the current spot price The MOST cost-efficient instances in AWS Useful for workloads that are resilient to failure: Batch jobs Data analysis Image processing Any distributed workloads Workloads with a flexible start and end time Not suitable for critical jobs or databases EC2 Dedicated Hosts A physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use Allows you to address compliance requirements and use your existing server-bound software licenses (per-socket, per-core, per-VM software licenses) Purchasing Options: On-demand \u2013 pay per second for active Dedicated Host Reserved - 1 or 3 years (No Upfront, Partial Upfront, All Upfront) The most expensive option Useful for software that has complicated licensing models (BYOL \u2013 Bring Your Own License) or for companies with strong regulatory or compliance needs EC2 Dedicated Instances Instances run on hardware that\u2019s dedicated to you May share hardware with other instances in the same account No control over instance placement (can move hardware after Stop / Start) EC2 Capacity Reservations Reserve On-Demand instances capacity in a specific AZ for any duration You always have access to EC2 capacity when you need it No time commitment (create/cancel anytime), no billing discounts Combine with Regional Reserved Instances and Savings Plans to benefit from billing discounts You\u2019re charged at On-Demand rate whether you run instances or not Suitable for short-term, uninterrupted workloads that need to be in a specific AZ Which purchasing option is right for me? On demand : coming and staying in resort whenever we like, we pay the full price Reserved : like planning ahead and if we plan to stay for a long time, we may get a good discount. Savings Plans : pay a certain amount per hour for a certain period and stay in any room type (e.g., King, Suite, Sea View) Spot instances : the hotel allows people to bid for the empty rooms and the highest bidder keeps the rooms. You can get kicked out at any time Dedicated Hosts : We book an entire building of the resort Capacity Reservations : you book a room for a period with full price even if you don\u2019t stay in it Price Comparison Example \u2013 m4.large \u2013 us-east-1 Price Type Price (per hour) On-Demand $0.10 Spot Instance (Spot Price) $0.038 - $0.039 (up to 61% off) Reserved Instance (1 year) $0.062 (No Upfront) - $0.058 (All Upfront) Reserved Instance (3 years) $0.043 (No Upfront) - $0.037 (All Upfront) EC2 Savings Plan (1 year) $0.062 (No Upfront) - $0.058 (All Upfront) Reserved Convertible Instance (1 year) $0.071 (No Upfront) - $0.066 (All Upfront) Dedicated Host On-Demand Price [Varies by instance] Dedicated Host Reservation Up to 70% off Capacity Reservations On-Demand Price EC2 Spot Instance Requests Can get a discount of up to 90% compared to On-demand Define max spot price and get the instance while current spot price < max The hourly spot price varies based on offer and capacity If the current spot price > your max price, you can choose to stop or terminate your instance with a 2-minute grace period. Used for batch jobs, data analysis, or workloads that are resilient to failures. Not great for critical jobs or databases EC2 Spot Instances Pricing EC2 Spot Instance Pricing How to terminate Spot Instances? Spot Instance Termination Guide You can only cancel Spot Instance requests that are open, active, or disabled. Cancelling a Spot Request does not terminate instances. You must first cancel a Spot Request, and then terminate the associated Spot Instances. Spot Fleets Spot Fleets = set of Spot Instances + (optional) On-Demand Instances The Spot Fleet will try to meet the target capacity with price constraints Define possible launch pools: instance type (m5.large), OS, Availability Zone Can have multiple launch pools, so that the fleet can choose Spot Fleet stops launching instances when reaching capacity or max cost Strategies to allocate Spot Instances: lowestPrice : from the pool with the lowest price (cost optimization, short workload) diversified : distributed across all pools (great for availability, long workloads) capacityOptimized : pool with the optimal capacity for the number of instances priceCapacityOptimized (recommended): pools with the highest capacity available, then select the pool with the lowest price (best choice for most workloads) Spot Fleets allow us to automatically request Spot Instances with the lowest price --- Placement Groups Sometimes you want control over the EC2 Instance placement strategy. That strategy can be defined using placement groups . When you create a placement group, you specify one of the following strategies for the group: Cluster \u2014clusters instances into a low-latency group in a single Availability Zone. Spread \u2014spreads instances across underlying hardware (max 7 instances per group per AZ). Partition \u2014spreads instances across many different partitions (which rely on different sets of racks) within an AZ. Scales to 100s of EC2 instances per group (Hadoop, Cassandra, Kafka). Cluster Placement Group Pros Cons - Great network (10 Gbps bandwidth between instances with Enhanced Networking enabled - recommended) - If the AZ fails, all instances fail at the same time. Use case: - Big Data job that needs to complete fast - Application that needs extremely low latency and high network throughput Placement Groups Spread Pros Cons - Can span across Availability Zones (AZ) - Limited to 7 instances per AZ per placement group - Reduced risk of simultaneous failure - EC2 Instances are on different physical hardware Use case: Application that needs to maximize high availability Critical applications where each instance must be isolated from failure from each other Placements Groups Partition Up to 7 partitions per AZ. Can span across multiple AZs in the same region. Up to 100s of EC2 instances. The instances in a partition do not share racks with the instances in the other partitions. A partition failure can affect many EC2 instances but won\u2019t affect other partitions. EC2 instances get access to the partition information as metadata. Use cases: HDFS, HBase, Cassandra, Kafka.","title":"EC2"},{"location":"compute-services/ec2/#ec2-instance-types","text":"You can use different types of EC2 instances that are optimized for different use cases ( AWS EC2 Instance Types ) AWS has the following naming convention: m5.2xlarge - m: instance class - 5: generation (AWS improves them over time) - 2xlarge: size within the instance class","title":"EC2 Instance Types"},{"location":"compute-services/ec2/#general-purpose","text":"Instance Types M5, M5a, M5ad, M5d, M5dn, M5n, M5zn, M6a, M6g, M6gd, M6i, M6id, M6idn, M6in --------------------------------------------------------------------------- M7a, M7g, M7gd, M7i, M7i-flex, M8a, M8g, M8gb, M8gd, M8gn, M8i, M8i-flex --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mac1, Mac2, Mac2-m1ultra, Mac2-m2, Mac2-m2pro, Mac-m4, Mac-m4pro --------------------------------------------------------------------------- T2, T3, T3a, T4g Provide a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources.

Volume An EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run. It allows your instances to persist data, even after their termination. They can only be mounted to one instance at a time . They are bound to a specific availability zone . Analogy : Think of them as a \u201cnetwork USB stick\u201d. EBS Volume Details It\u2019s a network drive (i.e., not a physical drive). It uses the network to communicate with the instance, which means there might be a bit of latency. It can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly. It\u2019s locked to an Availability Zone (AZ). An EBS Volume in us-east-1a cannot be attached to us-east-1b . To move a volume across, you first need to snapshot it. Have a provisioned capacity (size in GBs, and IOPS). You get billed for all the provisioned capacity. You can increase the capacity of the drive over time. EBS \u2013 Delete on Termination Attribute Controls the EBS behavior when an EC2 instance terminates : By default, the root EBS volume is deleted (attribute enabled). By default, any other attached EBS volume is not deleted (attribute disabled). This can be controlled by the AWS console or AWS CLI. Use case : Preserve the root volume when an instance is terminated. EBS Snapshots Make a backup (snapshot) of your EBS volume at a point in time. It\u2019s not necessary to detach the volume to do a snapshot, but it\u2019s recommended. Snapshots can be copied across AZs or Regions. EBS Snapshots Features EBS Snapshot Archive : Move a Snapshot to an \u201carchive tier\u201d that is 75% cheaper. Restores take 24 to 72 hours. Recycle Bin for EBS Snapshots : Setup rules to retain deleted snapshots so you can recover them after accidental deletion. Specify retention (from 1 day to 1 year). Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR) : Force full initialization of the snapshot to have no latency on the first use (extra cost). EBS Volume Types EBS Volumes come in 6 types: Volume Type Description gp2 / gp3 (SSD) General-purpose SSD volume balancing price and performance io1 / io2 Block Express (SSD) Highest-performance SSD volume for mission-critical, low-latency or high-throughput workloads st1 (HDD) Low-cost HDD volume for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads sc1 (HDD) Lowest-cost HDD volume for less frequently accessed workloads EBS volumes are characterized by Size | Throughput | IOPS (I/O operations per second). When in doubt, always consult the AWS documentation. Only gp2/gp3 and io1/io2 Block Express can be used as boot volumes. EBS Volume Types - Use Cases General Purpose SSD (gp2 / gp3) Cost-effective storage with low-latency. Use cases: System boot volumes, virtual desktops, development, and test environments. gp3: Baseline of 3,000 IOPS and throughput of 125 MiB/s. Can increase IOPS up to 16,000 and throughput up to 1000 MiB/s independently. gp2: Small volumes can burst IOPS to 3,000. IOPS is tied to the size of the volume (max IOPS is 16,000). Provisioned IOPS (PIOPS) SSD (io1 / io2 Block Express) Critical business applications with sustained IOPS performance. Great for database workloads (sensitive to storage performance and consistency). io1 (4 GiB - 16 TiB): Max IOPS: 64,000 for Nitro EC2 instances & 32,000 for other instances. Can increase IOPS independently from storage size. io2 Block Express (4 GiB - 64 TiB): Sub-millisecond latency. Max IOPS: 256,000 with an IOPS:GiB ratio of 1,000:1. Supports EBS Multi-Attach . Hard Disk Drives (HDD) \u2013 st1 / sc1 Cannot be a boot volume. st1 : For Big Data, Data Warehouses, Log Processing. Max throughput 500 MiB/s, max IOPS 500. sc1 : For data that is infrequently accessed. Suitable for scenarios where the lowest cost is important. Max throughput 250 MiB/s, max IOPS 250. EBS Volume Types - Summary For more information on EBS volume types, consult AWS Documentation . EBS Multi-Attach \u2013 io1/io2 family - Attach the same EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances in the same AZ. - Each instance has full read and write permissions to the high-performance volume. - Use case : - Achieve higher application availability in clustered Linux applications (e.g., Teradata). - Applications must manage concurrent write operations. - Up to 16 EC2 instances at a time. - Must use a file system that\u2019s cluster-aware (not XFS, EXT4, etc.). EBS Encryption When you create an encrypted EBS volume, the following happens: Data at rest is encrypted inside the volume. All data in flight moving between the instance and the volume is encrypted. All snapshots are encrypted. All volumes created from the snapshot are encrypted. Encryption is handled transparently (no manual work needed). Minimal impact on latency.

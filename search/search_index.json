pre-built serverless applications. 1. The Core Exam Concept: \"Don't Reinvent the Wheel\" The primary exam scenario for SAR is reducing duplicated effort . Scenario: Your company has 50 different teams. Every team needs a specific Lambda function that rotates API keys or resizes images. Bad Solution: Every team writes their own Lambda code (wasted time, inconsistent quality). Exam Answer (SAR): One team writes the \"Gold Standard\" function, publishes it to the Serverless Application Repository (Private), and all 50 teams just \"pull and deploy\" it into their accounts. 2. Key Technical Features (Exam Cheat Sheet) A. How it works (The Stack) Underlying Tech: It runs on AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) . Deployment: When you \"deploy\" an app from the Repository, it actually creates a CloudFormation Stack in your account. Nested Applications: You can include a SAR application inside your own serverless application. It becomes a \"Nested Stack.\" Exam Tip: If a question asks how to include a reusable auth module in your SAM template without copying the code, look for \"Nested Application\" or \"AWS::Serverless::Application\" . B. Sharing Models (Public vs. Private) The exam often tests who can see your application. Public: Shared with the world (anyone with an AWS account). Private: Only visible to the account that created it. Privately Shared (Critical): Shared with specific AWS Account IDs or an entire AWS Organization . Keyword: \"Resource-based Policy.\" You control access by attaching a policy to the application, just like an S3 Bucket Policy. C. Cost The Service: Free. There is no charge to host or browse the repository. The Resources: You Pay. If you deploy a Lambda function from the repository, you pay for that Lambda's invocations and duration in your account. 3. Serverless Repo vs. AWS Marketplace This is a common confusion point on the exam. Feature Serverless App Repository AWS Marketplace Primary Use Internal code sharing / Open Source patterns. Selling/Buying enterprise software. Cost Free to use (pay for underlying resources). Often has licensing fees (SaaS subscriptions). Publisher Developers, Internal Teams. Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) like Splunk, Palo Alto. Exam Trigger \"Share reusable code across teams,\" \"Standardize serverless patterns.\" \"Buy a managed firewall,\" \"Deploy a third-party AMI,\" \"Pay hourly software fees.\" 4. Example Exam Question Scenario Question: A company wants to standardize a serverless backend for their mobile apps. Multiple development teams need to use the same backend structure (API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB) but strictly within their own AWS accounts. The solution must minimize code duplication and ensure all teams use the approved architecture. Correct Answer: Use AWS SAM to define the application. Publish it to the AWS Serverless Application Repository with Private Sharing enabled for the company's AWS Organization. Instruct teams to deploy the application from the repository as a nested stack. Why: SAM: Defines the serverless structure. Repo: Centralizes the storage. Private/Org Sharing: Secures it so only employees can see it. Nested Stack: Allows them to integrate it easily.","title":"AWS Serverless Application Repository"},{"location":"compute/serverless-application-repository/#1-the-core-exam-concept-dont-reinvent-the-wheel","text":"The primary exam scenario for SAR is reducing duplicated effort .

The Problem it Solves: Normally, mobile traffic has to travel from the device Cell Tower Telco Core Network Internet AWS Region. This introduces latency (lag). The Wavelength Solution: Traffic goes from Device Cell Tower Wavelength Zone (AWS servers inside the Telco facility). It skips the public internet hop entirely for the lowest possible latency to mobile devices. 2. Key Architecture Concepts for the Exam Wavelength Zones Similar to an Availability Zone (AZ) but located inside a carrier's 5G network (e.g., Verizon in the US, Vodafone in Europe). VPC Extension: You extend your existing VPC to a Wavelength Zone. You create a subnet in the Wavelength Zone, just like you would in a regular AZ. Carrier Gateway Critical Exam Keyword: Just as an Internet Gateway connects a VPC to the Internet, a Carrier Gateway allows resources in the Wavelength subnet to communicate with the carrier's mobile network and the internet. Function: It performs NAT (Network Address Translation) to assign carrier IP addresses to your EC2 instances so mobile devices can reach them directly. 3. Common Exam Scenarios (Use Cases) If a question describes one of these scenarios, look for AWS Wavelength in the answers: Scenario Keywords to Watch For Smart Cities / IoT \"Connected vehicles,\" \"Traffic analysis,\" \"5G IoT sensors.\" Real-time Gaming \"Game streaming to mobile devices,\" \"Minimize jitter for mobile players.\" AR / VR \"Augmented Reality rendering,\" \"Virtual Reality for field workers,\" \"Low latency rendering.\" Machine Learning Inference \"Real-time inference at the edge,\" \"Medical image analysis on mobile tablets.\" 4. \"Edge\" Service Comparison: The Exam Trap The exam often asks you to choose between Outposts , Local Zones , and Wavelength . Use this cheat sheet to distinguish them: Choose AWS Wavelength if: The users are on Mobile / 5G devices . You need ultra-low latency specifically for mobile networks . You do not own the data center (it's the Telco's facility). Choose AWS Local Zones if: The users are generic internet users (corporate offices, home gamers, content creators) in a specific city (e.g., Los Angeles, Houston). You need single-digit millisecond latency to a specific geographic metro area , regardless of whether they are on 5G, Wi-Fi, or wired fiber. Choose AWS Outposts if: The workload must run on-premises (in your own physical building/data center).

Core Concept: \"Proactive\" Cost Control In the exam, if a question asks how to \"prevent overspending\" or \"get notified before costs exceed a limit,\" the answer is almost always AWS Budgets . Cost Explorer = Looking backward (Analysis/Forensics). AWS Budgets = Looking forward/current (Monitoring/Alerting). 2. The 4 Types of Budgets (Exam Scenarios) You can set up four specific types of budgets. You must know which one applies to which scenario. Budget Type What it tracks Exam Scenario Keyword Cost Budget Money ($$$) \"Notify me if my monthly bill goes over $1,000.\" Usage Budget Resources (GB, Hours) \"Notify me if my S3 buckets exceed 100 GB of storage\" or \"If we use more than 1,000 EC2 hours.\" Reservation Budget Utilization / Coverage \"Alert if our Reserved Instance (RI) utilization drops below 80%.\" (Means you are wasting the RIs you paid for). Savings Plans Budget Utilization / Coverage \"Alert if our Savings Plan coverage drops below 90%.\" 3. Alerting Logic: Actual vs. Forecasted This is a common \"trick\" in exam questions. You can set alerts on two different timelines: Actual Costs: \"Alert me when I have already spent 80% of my budget.\" Risk: You might have already blown the budget by the time you react. Forecasted Costs: \"Alert me when AWS predicts I will exceed my budget based on current usage trends.\" Exam Value: This is the most proactive setting. It allows you to stop a runaway process (like a recursive Lambda loop) before the bill gets too high. 4. AWS Budget Actions (High Probability Topic) This is the most advanced and frequently tested feature. AWS Budgets can do more than just send an email; it can take action to stop the spending. How it works: When a threshold is breached (e.g., \"Cost > $500\"), AWS Budgets can automatically: Stop an EC2 Instance: (Specific Region/ID). Stop an RDS Database. Attach an IAM Policy: It can attach a \"Deny All\" policy to a user or role, effectively locking them out of creating new resources. Apply a Service Control Policy (SCP): If using AWS Organizations, it can block resource creation for an entire sub-account. The Workflow: Budget Breach SNS Topic Lambda Function (or System Manager) Action Executed 5. Notifications & Reporting SNS (Simple Notification Service): Budgets send alerts to an SNS topic. From there, you can fan out to: Email (Managers). SMS (Sysadmins). AWS Chatbot (Slack/Chime). Lambda (Automated remediation). AWS Budgets Reports: You can configure a report to be emailed to you (Daily, Weekly, Monthly) summarizing your budget status. Exam Tip: This costs $0.01 per report!

What is the AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR)? Definition: The most comprehensive and granular set of cost and usage data available in AWS. Format: It is not a dashboard (like Cost Explorer). It is a raw data file (CSV or Parquet) that AWS delivers to an Amazon S3 bucket you define. Update Frequency: AWS updates the report in your bucket at least once a day. 2. Exam Keywords & Triggers If you see these phrases in a question, CUR is likely the answer: \"Most granular data available...\" \"Analyze costs at the individual resource ID level...\" \"Integrate billing data with third-party accounting tools...\" \"Use SQL to query billing data...\" (implies CUR + Athena) \"Create custom visualizations using Amazon QuickSight ...\" 3. Key Features for SAA-C03 A. Granularity (The #1 Differentiator) Cost Explorer shows you costs by Service (e.g., \"EC2\") or Linked Account . CUR shows you costs by Resource ID (e.g., \"i-1234567890abcdef0\"). Scenario: You need to find out exactly which specific EC2 instance contributed to a price spike at 2:00 AM. Cost Explorer might just show \"EC2 rose,\" but CUR will show the specific instance ID and the exact hour. B. Integration Ecosystem (The Architecture Pattern) The exam often tests the \"pipeline\" of cost analysis. You should memorize this flow: Source: AWS Billing generates the CUR . Storage: CUR is delivered to an S3 Bucket . Query: You use Amazon Athena to run SQL queries on the CUR files in S3. Visualize: You connect Amazon QuickSight to Athena to build custom dashboards. C. Cost Allocation Tags CUR includes all your active Cost Allocation Tags . Exam Tip: You must activate tags in the Billing Console before they appear in the CUR. They are not retroactive. D. Reserved Instances (RI) & Savings Plans CUR provides columns specifically for amortized costs, helping you understand how your RIs or Savings Plans are being applied across your accounts on an hourly basis. 4.

Realistic Exam Scenario Question: A company needs to perform a detailed analysis of their AWS costs to determine the exact storage cost of each individual S3 object and EC2 volume for internal chargeback. The solution must allow the use of standard SQL queries to analyze the data. Which solution should the Solutions Architect recommend? A) Use AWS Cost Explorer to filter by resource tags. (Incorrect - Cost Explorer is not for SQL or individual object/resource deep dives). B) Use AWS Budgets to set a threshold for S3 and EBS costs. (Incorrect - This alerts on cost, it doesn't analyze it). C) Enable the AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR) to deliver files to an S3 bucket, and use Amazon Athena to query the data. ( Correct - \"Detailed analysis,\" \"SQL,\" and \"S3 delivery\" match CUR). D) Use Amazon CloudWatch metrics to calculate the cost.

What is Amazon Kinesis Video Streams (KVS)? It is a fully managed AWS service that streams media securely from connected devices to AWS for analytics, machine learning (ML), playback, and other processing. \"Media\" usually means Video (from security cameras, drones, smartphones), but it can also be Audio, RADAR, or LIDAR data. Key Concept: It is \"Serverless\" storage for streaming video. You don't provision hard drives; you just stream data in, and AWS stores it. 2. The \"Golden\" Exam Pattern: KVS + Rekognition This is the #1 most likely scenario you will see involving Kinesis Video Streams on the exam. The Scenario: A company needs to analyze live video feeds from security cameras to detect people, faces, or objects in real-time . The Architecture: Source: Security Cameras (Producers) stream video. Ingestion: Amazon Kinesis Video Streams receives the stream. Consumer/Processor: Amazon Rekognition Video reads the stream directly from KVS. Action: Rekognition detects a person/face and sends a notification (e.g., via SNS or Kinesis Data Streams) to alert a security team. Exam Tip: If a question mentions \"real-time video analysis,\" \"detecting known faces in a live feed,\" or \"analyzing surveillance footage,\" the answer is almost always Kinesis Video Streams + Amazon Rekognition . 3. Two Modes of Kinesis Video Streams The exam might test your knowledge on latency or communication direction . A. Standard Video Streams Direction: One-way (Producer -> AWS). Latency: Live, but with a slight delay (3\u20135 seconds). Use Case: Security footage recording, machine learning analysis (Rekognition), storage for later playback. Protocols: HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) or DASH for playback. B. Kinesis Video Streams with WebRTC Direction: Two-way (Bidirectional). Latency: Ultra-low latency (sub-second). Use Case: Video chatting, doorbell cameras where you talk back to the delivery person, peer-to-peer media streaming. Exam Keyword: If the question asks for \"two-way audio/video\" or \"interacting with the camera user,\" look for WebRTC . 4. Producers and Consumers Producers (Input): Security cameras (IP cameras). Smartphones (App using KVS SDK). Drones. AWS DeepLens (AWS's own ML-enabled camera). Consumers (Output): Amazon Rekognition Video: For ML analysis. Amazon SageMaker: If you have a custom ML model (not just standard face detection) that you want to run on the video feed. EC2 Instances / Fargate: Running custom image processing code (e.g., OpenCV) that reads the stream. 5. Confusion Corner: KVS vs. Kinesis Data Streams The exam will try to trick you by offering both as options. Feature Kinesis Data Streams (KDS) Kinesis Video Streams (KVS) Data Type Text, Logs, Clickstreams, IoT sensor readings (numbers/strings). Binary Media: Video, Audio, RADAR, LIDAR. Example \"Analyze stock prices in real-time.\" \"Detect a person in a video feed.\" Integration Lambda, Kinesis Firehose, Flink. Rekognition, SageMaker, OpenCV. Retention 24 hours to 365 days. Can store media indefinitely (custom retention). 6. Sample Exam Scenario Question: A retail company wants to use its existing security cameras to monitor customer foot traffic and detect when lines at the checkout counters become too long in real-time. The solution must notify the store manager immediately. Which architecture is the most operationally efficient? Options: A. Save video files to an S3 bucket. Trigger an S3 Event Notification to call a Lambda function to process the video. B. Stream video to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. Use Kinesis Data Analytics to count the people. C. Stream video to Amazon Kinesis Video Streams. Configure Amazon Rekognition Video to analyze the stream and alert via Amazon SNS. D. Connect cameras to an EC2 instance. Run a custom Python script to analyze the video and email the manager. Correct Answer: C Why C? It uses the native \"Video Stream -> Rekognition\" pattern. It is \"operationally efficient\" (Serverless/Managed). Why not A? S3 is for files , not streams . Waiting for a file to close and upload introduces high latency; it's not \"real-time.\" Why not B?

What is Amazon Kinesis Video Streams (KVS)? It is a fully managed AWS service that streams media securely from connected devices to AWS for analytics, machine learning (ML), playback, and other processing. \"Media\" usually means Video (from security cameras, drones, smartphones), but it can also be Audio, RADAR, or LIDAR data. Key Concept: It is \"Serverless\" storage for streaming video. You don't provision hard drives; you just stream data in, and AWS stores it. 2. The \"Golden\" Exam Pattern: KVS + Rekognition This is the #1 most likely scenario you will see involving Kinesis Video Streams on the exam. The Scenario: A company needs to analyze live video feeds from security cameras to detect people, faces, or objects in real-time . The Architecture: Source: Security Cameras (Producers) stream video. Ingestion: Amazon Kinesis Video Streams receives the stream. Consumer/Processor: Amazon Rekognition Video reads the stream directly from KVS. Action: Rekognition detects a person/face and sends a notification (e.g., via SNS or Kinesis Data Streams) to alert a security team. Exam Tip: If a question mentions \"real-time video analysis,\" \"detecting known faces in a live feed,\" or \"analyzing surveillance footage,\" the answer is almost always Kinesis Video Streams + Amazon Rekognition . 3. Two Modes of Kinesis Video Streams The exam might test your knowledge on latency or communication direction . A. Standard Video Streams Direction: One-way (Producer -> AWS). Latency: Live, but with a slight delay (3\u20135 seconds). Use Case: Security footage recording, machine learning analysis (Rekognition), storage for later playback. Protocols: HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) or DASH for playback. B. Kinesis Video Streams with WebRTC Direction: Two-way (Bidirectional). Latency: Ultra-low latency (sub-second). Use Case: Video chatting, doorbell cameras where you talk back to the delivery person, peer-to-peer media streaming. Exam Keyword: If the question asks for \"two-way audio/video\" or \"interacting with the camera user,\" look for WebRTC . 4. Producers and Consumers Producers (Input): Security cameras (IP cameras). Smartphones (App using KVS SDK). Drones. AWS DeepLens (AWS's own ML-enabled camera). Consumers (Output): Amazon Rekognition Video: For ML analysis. Amazon SageMaker: If you have a custom ML model (not just standard face detection) that you want to run on the video feed. EC2 Instances / Fargate: Running custom image processing code (e.g., OpenCV) that reads the stream. 5. Confusion Corner: KVS vs. Kinesis Data Streams The exam will try to trick you by offering both as options. Feature Kinesis Data Streams (KDS) Kinesis Video Streams (KVS) Data Type Text, Logs, Clickstreams, IoT sensor readings (numbers/strings). Binary Media: Video, Audio, RADAR, LIDAR. Example \"Analyze stock prices in real-time.\" \"Detect a person in a video feed.\" Integration Lambda, Kinesis Firehose, Flink. Rekognition, SageMaker, OpenCV. Retention 24 hours to 365 days. Can store media indefinitely (custom retention). 6. Sample Exam Scenario Question: A retail company wants to use its existing security cameras to monitor customer foot traffic and detect when lines at the checkout counters become too long in real-time. The solution must notify the store manager immediately. Which architecture is the most operationally efficient? Options: A. Save video files to an S3 bucket. Trigger an S3 Event Notification to call a Lambda function to process the video. B. Stream video to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. Use Kinesis Data Analytics to count the people. C. Stream video to Amazon Kinesis Video Streams. Configure Amazon Rekognition Video to analyze the stream and alert via Amazon SNS. D. Connect cameras to an EC2 instance. Run a custom Python script to analyze the video and email the manager. Correct Answer: C Why C? It uses the native \"Video Stream -> Rekognition\" pattern. It is \"operationally efficient\" (Serverless/Managed). Why not A? S3 is for files , not streams . Waiting for a file to close and upload introduces high latency; it's not \"real-time.\" Why not B? Kinesis Data Streams is for text/logs, not video binary data. Why not D? Managing EC2 instances and custom scripts is high operational overhead compared to using managed services like Rekognition.","title":"Amazon Kinesis Video Streams"},{"location":"media-services/kinesis-video-streams/#1-what-is-amazon-kinesis-video-streams-kvs","text":"It is a fully managed AWS service that streams media securely from connected devices to AWS for analytics, machine learning (ML), playback, and other processing. \"Media\" usually means Video (from security cameras, drones, smartphones), but it can also be Audio, RADAR, or LIDAR data.

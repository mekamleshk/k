pre-built serverless applications. 1. The Core Exam Concept: \"Don't Reinvent the Wheel\" The primary exam scenario for SAR is reducing duplicated effort . Scenario: Your company has 50 different teams. Every team needs a specific Lambda function that rotates API keys or resizes images. Bad Solution: Every team writes their own Lambda code (wasted time, inconsistent quality). Exam Answer (SAR): One team writes the \"Gold Standard\" function, publishes it to the Serverless Application Repository (Private), and all 50 teams just \"pull and deploy\" it into their accounts. 2. Key Technical Features (Exam Cheat Sheet) A. How it works (The Stack) Underlying Tech: It runs on AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) . Deployment: When you \"deploy\" an app from the Repository, it actually creates a CloudFormation Stack in your account. Nested Applications: You can include a SAR application inside your own serverless application. It becomes a \"Nested Stack.\" Exam Tip: If a question asks how to include a reusable auth module in your SAM template without copying the code, look for \"Nested Application\" or \"AWS::Serverless::Application\" . B. Sharing Models (Public vs. Private) The exam often tests who can see your application. Public: Shared with the world (anyone with an AWS account). Private: Only visible to the account that created it. Privately Shared (Critical): Shared with specific AWS Account IDs or an entire AWS Organization . Keyword: \"Resource-based Policy.\" You control access by attaching a policy to the application, just like an S3 Bucket Policy. C. Cost The Service: Free. There is no charge to host or browse the repository. The Resources: You Pay. If you deploy a Lambda function from the repository, you pay for that Lambda's invocations and duration in your account. 3. Serverless Repo vs. AWS Marketplace This is a common confusion point on the exam. Feature Serverless App Repository AWS Marketplace Primary Use Internal code sharing / Open Source patterns. Selling/Buying enterprise software. Cost Free to use (pay for underlying resources). Often has licensing fees (SaaS subscriptions). Publisher Developers, Internal Teams. Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) like Splunk, Palo Alto. Exam Trigger \"Share reusable code across teams,\" \"Standardize serverless patterns.\" \"Buy a managed firewall,\" \"Deploy a third-party AMI,\" \"Pay hourly software fees.\" 4. Example Exam Question Scenario Question: A company wants to standardize a serverless backend for their mobile apps. Multiple development teams need to use the same backend structure (API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB) but strictly within their own AWS accounts. The solution must minimize code duplication and ensure all teams use the approved architecture. Correct Answer: Use AWS SAM to define the application. Publish it to the AWS Serverless Application Repository with Private Sharing enabled for the company's AWS Organization. Instruct teams to deploy the application from the repository as a nested stack. Why: SAM: Defines the serverless structure. Repo: Centralizes the storage. Private/Org Sharing: Secures it so only employees can see it. Nested Stack: Allows them to integrate it easily.","title":"AWS Serverless Application Repository"},{"location":"compute/serverless-application-repository/#1-the-core-exam-concept-dont-reinvent-the-wheel","text":"The primary exam scenario for SAR is reducing duplicated effort .

The Problem it Solves: Normally, mobile traffic has to travel from the device Cell Tower Telco Core Network Internet AWS Region. This introduces latency (lag). The Wavelength Solution: Traffic goes from Device Cell Tower Wavelength Zone (AWS servers inside the Telco facility). It skips the public internet hop entirely for the lowest possible latency to mobile devices. 2. Key Architecture Concepts for the Exam Wavelength Zones Similar to an Availability Zone (AZ) but located inside a carrier's 5G network (e.g., Verizon in the US, Vodafone in Europe). VPC Extension: You extend your existing VPC to a Wavelength Zone. You create a subnet in the Wavelength Zone, just like you would in a regular AZ. Carrier Gateway Critical Exam Keyword: Just as an Internet Gateway connects a VPC to the Internet, a Carrier Gateway allows resources in the Wavelength subnet to communicate with the carrier's mobile network and the internet. Function: It performs NAT (Network Address Translation) to assign carrier IP addresses to your EC2 instances so mobile devices can reach them directly. 3. Common Exam Scenarios (Use Cases) If a question describes one of these scenarios, look for AWS Wavelength in the answers: Scenario Keywords to Watch For Smart Cities / IoT \"Connected vehicles,\" \"Traffic analysis,\" \"5G IoT sensors.\" Real-time Gaming \"Game streaming to mobile devices,\" \"Minimize jitter for mobile players.\" AR / VR \"Augmented Reality rendering,\" \"Virtual Reality for field workers,\" \"Low latency rendering.\" Machine Learning Inference \"Real-time inference at the edge,\" \"Medical image analysis on mobile tablets.\" 4. \"Edge\" Service Comparison: The Exam Trap The exam often asks you to choose between Outposts , Local Zones , and Wavelength . Use this cheat sheet to distinguish them: Choose AWS Wavelength if: The users are on Mobile / 5G devices . You need ultra-low latency specifically for mobile networks . You do not own the data center (it's the Telco's facility). Choose AWS Local Zones if: The users are generic internet users (corporate offices, home gamers, content creators) in a specific city (e.g., Los Angeles, Houston). You need single-digit millisecond latency to a specific geographic metro area , regardless of whether they are on 5G, Wi-Fi, or wired fiber.

Core Concept: \"Proactive\" Cost Control In the exam, if a question asks how to \"prevent overspending\" or \"get notified before costs exceed a limit,\" the answer is almost always AWS Budgets . Cost Explorer = Looking backward (Analysis/Forensics). AWS Budgets = Looking forward/current (Monitoring/Alerting). 2. The 4 Types of Budgets (Exam Scenarios) You can set up four specific types of budgets. You must know which one applies to which scenario. Budget Type What it tracks Exam Scenario Keyword Cost Budget Money ($$$) \"Notify me if my monthly bill goes over $1,000.\" Usage Budget Resources (GB, Hours) \"Notify me if my S3 buckets exceed 100 GB of storage\" or \"If we use more than 1,000 EC2 hours.\" Reservation Budget Utilization / Coverage \"Alert if our Reserved Instance (RI) utilization drops below 80%.\" (Means you are wasting the RIs you paid for). Savings Plans Budget Utilization / Coverage \"Alert if our Savings Plan coverage drops below 90%.\" 3. Alerting Logic: Actual vs. Forecasted This is a common \"trick\" in exam questions. You can set alerts on two different timelines: Actual Costs: \"Alert me when I have already spent 80% of my budget.\" Risk: You might have already blown the budget by the time you react. Forecasted Costs: \"Alert me when AWS predicts I will exceed my budget based on current usage trends.\" Exam Value: This is the most proactive setting. It allows you to stop a runaway process (like a recursive Lambda loop) before the bill gets too high. 4. AWS Budget Actions (High Probability Topic) This is the most advanced and frequently tested feature. AWS Budgets can do more than just send an email; it can take action to stop the spending. How it works: When a threshold is breached (e.g., \"Cost > $500\"), AWS Budgets can automatically: Stop an EC2 Instance: (Specific Region/ID). Stop an RDS Database. Attach an IAM Policy: It can attach a \"Deny All\" policy to a user or role, effectively locking them out of creating new resources. Apply a Service Control Policy (SCP): If using AWS Organizations, it can block resource creation for an entire sub-account. The Workflow: Budget Breach SNS Topic Lambda Function (or System Manager) Action Executed 5. Notifications & Reporting SNS (Simple Notification Service): Budgets send alerts to an SNS topic. From there, you can fan out to: Email (Managers). SMS (Sysadmins). AWS Chatbot (Slack/Chime). Lambda (Automated remediation). AWS Budgets Reports: You can configure a report to be emailed to you (Daily, Weekly, Monthly) summarizing your budget status. Exam Tip: This costs $0.01 per report!

What is the AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR)? Definition: The most comprehensive and granular set of cost and usage data available in AWS. Format: It is not a dashboard (like Cost Explorer). It is a raw data file (CSV or Parquet) that AWS delivers to an Amazon S3 bucket you define. Update Frequency: AWS updates the report in your bucket at least once a day. 2. Exam Keywords & Triggers If you see these phrases in a question, CUR is likely the answer: \"Most granular data available...\" \"Analyze costs at the individual resource ID level...\" \"Integrate billing data with third-party accounting tools...\" \"Use SQL to query billing data...\" (implies CUR + Athena) \"Create custom visualizations using Amazon QuickSight ...\" 3. Key Features for SAA-C03 A. Granularity (The #1 Differentiator) Cost Explorer shows you costs by Service (e.g., \"EC2\") or Linked Account . CUR shows you costs by Resource ID (e.g., \"i-1234567890abcdef0\"). Scenario: You need to find out exactly which specific EC2 instance contributed to a price spike at 2:00 AM. Cost Explorer might just show \"EC2 rose,\" but CUR will show the specific instance ID and the exact hour. B. Integration Ecosystem (The Architecture Pattern) The exam often tests the \"pipeline\" of cost analysis. You should memorize this flow: Source: AWS Billing generates the CUR . Storage: CUR is delivered to an S3 Bucket . Query: You use Amazon Athena to run SQL queries on the CUR files in S3. Visualize: You connect Amazon QuickSight to Athena to build custom dashboards. C. Cost Allocation Tags CUR includes all your active Cost Allocation Tags . Exam Tip: You must activate tags in the Billing Console before they appear in the CUR. They are not retroactive. D. Reserved Instances (RI) & Savings Plans CUR provides columns specifically for amortized costs, helping you understand how your RIs or Savings Plans are being applied across your accounts on an hourly basis. 4.

Realistic Exam Scenario Question: A company needs to perform a detailed analysis of their AWS costs to determine the exact storage cost of each individual S3 object and EC2 volume for internal chargeback. The solution must allow the use of standard SQL queries to analyze the data. Which solution should the Solutions Architect recommend? A) Use AWS Cost Explorer to filter by resource tags. (Incorrect - Cost Explorer is not for SQL or individual object/resource deep dives). B) Use AWS Budgets to set a threshold for S3 and EBS costs. (Incorrect - This alerts on cost, it doesn't analyze it). C) Enable the AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR) to deliver files to an S3 bucket, and use Amazon Athena to query the data. ( Correct - \"Detailed analysis,\" \"SQL,\" and \"S3 delivery\" match CUR). D) Use Amazon CloudWatch metrics to calculate the cost.

What is AWS Proton? (The \"Elevator Pitch\") AWS Proton is a fully managed delivery service designed for Platform Engineering teams to manage infrastructure for container and serverless applications. The Problem: In a company with 100+ microservices, developers might define their own infrastructure (CloudFormation/Terraform) differently, leading to a \"mess\" of unstandardized configurations. The Solution: A central \"Platform Team\" creates Templates (standardized infrastructure stacks). \"Developer Teams\" then use these templates to self-serve and deploy their apps without worrying about the underlying infrastructure details. 2. Key Exam Terminology To answer Proton questions correctly, look for these specific terms: Platform Team vs. Developer Team: The exam often sets up a scenario with two distinct roles. The Platform team creates the standards; the Developer team consumes them. Templates: Environment Templates: Shared resources used by multiple applications (e.g., VPCs, shared Load Balancers, ECS Clusters). Service Templates: Infrastructure dedicated to a single application (e.g., Fargate Task Definition, Lambda function, CI/CD pipeline). Self-Service: Developers can deploy their own services using the approved templates without needing Administrator access to AWS. Version Control: If the Platform Team updates a template (e.g., adds better logging), Proton can push these updates to all running services that use that template. 3. \"Cheat Sheet\": Proton vs. Service Catalog vs. CloudFormation This is the most confusing part for candidates.

It manages the entire stack (including CI/CD pipelines) specifically for modern apps. It allows for centralized updates of the stack. Exam Rule of Thumb: If the scenario mentions \"managing a catalog of approved EC2 images/S3 buckets for compliance,\" choose Service Catalog . If the scenario mentions \"standardizing CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure for serverless/container microservices,\" choose AWS Proton . 4.

Summary for SAA-C03"},{"location":"management-and-governance/service-catalog/","text":"1. The Core Concept AWS Service Catalog allows organizations to create and manage catalogs of IT services that are approved for use on AWS. The Problem it Solves: Developers want to launch resources quickly, but the Security team doesn't want to give them full Admin access to creating whatever they want. The Solution: The Security/Cloud team creates \"Approved Templates\" (Products) and puts them in a \"Menu\" (Portfolio). Developers can only launch items from this menu. 2. Key Vocabulary (Exam Keywords) Product: A product is an IT service that you want to make available for deployment. Crucial for Exam: In Service Catalog, a \"Product\" is almost always defined by an AWS CloudFormation template . Portfolio: A collection of \"Products.\" You assign Portfolios to specific IAM Users, Groups, or Roles. Provisioning Artifact: This is simply a version of a product. (e.g., v1.0 of your web server uses t2.micro, v2.0 uses t3.micro). Constraints: Rules that limit how the product can be deployed. Example: You can launch an EC2 instance, but the constraint forces it to be a t2.micro or t3.micro . You cannot launch a c5.large . 3. The #1 Exam Topic: \"Launch Constraints\" (The Magic Trick) This is the most frequent Service Catalog question pattern on the exam. The Scenario: You have a Junior Developer. You do not want to give them permission to create EC2 instances directly (no ec2:RunInstances permission). However, you do want them to be able to launch a specific, approved Web Server for their project. The Solution: You use Service Catalog with a Launch Constraint . You create a Service Catalog Product (the Web Server CloudFormation template). You create an IAM Role that does have permission to create EC2 instances. You assign that Role to the Product as a Launch Constraint . The Junior Developer clicks \"Launch.\" The Result: The Developer triggers the launch, but the Service Catalog service assumes the Role to create the resources. The Developer never actually holds the permissions themselves. Exam Rule: If a question asks how to allow users to provision resources without granting them direct access to the underlying AWS services, the answer is AWS Service Catalog with Launch Constraints. 4. Deployment & Sharing (Multi-Account Strategy) The exam often asks how to share these standard templates across a large organization with many AWS accounts. Hub and Spoke Model: You create the Portfolios in a central \"Master\" or \"Hub\" account. AWS Organizations: You share the Portfolio with other AWS Accounts (or the entire Organization) using AWS Organizations integration. Importing: The \"Spoke\" (child) accounts import the portfolio so their local users can see the products. 5.

The Golden Rule of SSM (Prerequisites) Before SSM can work on an EC2 instance, two things must exist. If an exam scenario says \"SSM is not working,\" check these first: SSM Agent: Must be installed and running on the EC2 instance (it is pre-installed on Amazon Linux 2 and Amazon Linux 2023 AMIs). IAM Role: The EC2 instance must have an IAM role attached with the correct permissions policy (usually AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore ). 2. Top 3 \"Exam Star\" Features These three features appear most often in SAA-C03 questions. A. SSM Session Manager What it is: Allows you to SSH (Linux) or RDP (Windows) into instances directly from the AWS Console or CLI. The \"Killer\" Exam Scenario: \"A company requires secure access to EC2 instances without opening inbound ports (like port 22 or 3389) and without managing SSH keys .\" Why it\u2019s the answer: Traffic flows over HTTPS (TLS 1.2) via the SSM Agent. No need for a Bastion Host (Jump Box). Access is controlled via IAM Policies , not network rules. Every command typed is logged to S3 or CloudWatch Logs for auditing (Compliance). B. SSM Parameter Store What it is: Storage for configuration data (database strings, license codes) and secrets (passwords). Exam Scenario: \"You need a central location to store configuration variables for a Lambda function and EC2 fleet. The solution must be low cost .\" Key Concepts: SecureString: Encrypts sensitive data using a KMS key. Hierarchical Storage: Organize parameters like /dev/db/password or /prod/app/limit . Standard vs. Advanced: Standard: Free (up to 10k params), 4KB size limit. Advanced: Costs money, 8KB size limit, supports \"Parameter Policies\" (e.g., password expiration). VS Secrets Manager (Crucial Distinction): Use Parameter Store for configuration and simple secrets (Standard is free!). Use Secrets Manager if you need automatic rotation of secrets (e.g., automatically changing an RDS database password every 30 days). Parameter Store cannot do this natively without custom Lambda scripts. C. SSM Patch Manager What it is: Automates the process of patching managed instances with security updates. Exam Scenario: \"You need to ensure a fleet of 50 Linux servers is patched with the latest critical security updates every Saturday at 2 AM.\" Key Concepts: Patch Baseline: Defines which patches are approved (e.g., \"Critical updates released > 7 days ago\"). Maintenance Windows: Defines when the patching occurs to avoid disrupting production traffic. 3. Other Key SSM Capabilities D. SSM Run Command Concept: Execute a script/command on one or hundreds of instances simultaneously. Exam Scenario: \"You need to update a configuration file on 1,000 EC2 instances immediately.\" Benefit: No need to SSH into each machine individually. Results are reported centrally. E. SSM Automation Concept: Automates complex maintenance tasks using \"Runbooks.\" Exam Scenario: \"You need to create a hardened AMI (Amazon Machine Image) every month that includes the latest OS patches.\" Mechanism: SSM Automation can launch an instance -> patch it -> create an image -> terminate the instance. F. SSM Inventory Concept: Collects metadata from your instances. Exam Scenario: \"You need to generate a report of all software installed on your EC2 fleet to check for unlicensed software.\" 4. Cheat Sheet: Comparison for Exam Feature Primary Exam Use Case \"Trigger\" Keywords Session Manager Secure remote access No port 22/3389, No Bastion, Audit logs, IAM auth.

A Typical Exam Question Walkthrough Question: A company has an application running on private EC2 instances. A Solutions Architect needs to securely access these instances for troubleshooting. The solution must minimize operational overhead and avoid opening inbound ports to the internet. Which solution should they choose? A. Configure a Bastion Host in a public subnet and restrict Security Group access to the admin's IP. B. Use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager to access the instances. C. Use EC2 Instance Connect with a public IP address. D. Set up a Site-to-Site VPN to the VPC. Analysis: Option A: Requires managing an extra EC2 (overhead) and opening ports. Option B: Correct. No ports needed, no extra infrastructure (low overhead), highly secure. Option C: Requires a public IP (security risk for private instances). Option D: Valid connectivity, but high overhead (setup time/cost) just for troubleshooting access.

What is Amazon Kinesis Video Streams (KVS)? It is a fully managed AWS service that streams media securely from connected devices to AWS for analytics, machine learning (ML), playback, and other processing. \"Media\" usually means Video (from security cameras, drones, smartphones), but it can also be Audio, RADAR, or LIDAR data. Key Concept: It is \"Serverless\" storage for streaming video. You don't provision hard drives; you just stream data in, and AWS stores it. 2. The \"Golden\" Exam Pattern: KVS + Rekognition This is the #1 most likely scenario you will see involving Kinesis Video Streams on the exam. The Scenario: A company needs to analyze live video feeds from security cameras to detect people, faces, or objects in real-time . The Architecture: Source: Security Cameras (Producers) stream video. Ingestion: Amazon Kinesis Video Streams receives the stream. Consumer/Processor: Amazon Rekognition Video reads the stream directly from KVS. Action: Rekognition detects a person/face and sends a notification (e.g., via SNS or Kinesis Data Streams) to alert a security team. Exam Tip: If a question mentions \"real-time video analysis,\" \"detecting known faces in a live feed,\" or \"analyzing surveillance footage,\" the answer is almost always Kinesis Video Streams + Amazon Rekognition . 3. Two Modes of Kinesis Video Streams The exam might test your knowledge on latency or communication direction . A. Standard Video Streams Direction: One-way (Producer -> AWS). Latency: Live, but with a slight delay (3\u20135 seconds). Use Case: Security footage recording, machine learning analysis (Rekognition), storage for later playback. Protocols: HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) or DASH for playback. B. Kinesis Video Streams with WebRTC Direction: Two-way (Bidirectional). Latency: Ultra-low latency (sub-second). Use Case: Video chatting, doorbell cameras where you talk back to the delivery person, peer-to-peer media streaming. Exam Keyword: If the question asks for \"two-way audio/video\" or \"interacting with the camera user,\" look for WebRTC . 4. Producers and Consumers Producers (Input): Security cameras (IP cameras). Smartphones (App using KVS SDK). Drones. AWS DeepLens (AWS's own ML-enabled camera). Consumers (Output): Amazon Rekognition Video: For ML analysis. Amazon SageMaker: If you have a custom ML model (not just standard face detection) that you want to run on the video feed. EC2 Instances / Fargate: Running custom image processing code (e.g., OpenCV) that reads the stream. 5. Confusion Corner: KVS vs. Kinesis Data Streams The exam will try to trick you by offering both as options. Feature Kinesis Data Streams (KDS) Kinesis Video Streams (KVS) Data Type Text, Logs, Clickstreams, IoT sensor readings (numbers/strings). Binary Media: Video, Audio, RADAR, LIDAR. Example \"Analyze stock prices in real-time.\" \"Detect a person in a video feed.\" Integration Lambda, Kinesis Firehose, Flink. Rekognition, SageMaker, OpenCV. Retention 24 hours to 365 days.

Sample Exam Scenario Question: A retail company wants to use its existing security cameras to monitor customer foot traffic and detect when lines at the checkout counters become too long in real-time. The solution must notify the store manager immediately. Which architecture is the most operationally efficient? Options: A. Save video files to an S3 bucket.
